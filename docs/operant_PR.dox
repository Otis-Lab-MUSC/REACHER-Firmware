 * @brief Progressive ratio operant conditioning task.
 * 
 * @section overview Overview
 * The Operant PR (Progressive Ratio) project implements a task where the number of lever presses required for a reward increases after each reward delivery. It features a cue tone, pump infusion, and optional laser stimulation.
 * 
 * @section features Key Features
 * - **Progressive ratio**: Required presses increment by a fixed step (e.g., 2) after each reward.
 * - **Timeout period**: Rewards are unavailable for a set time post-cue.
 * - **Laser pulsing**: Periodic stimulation independent of lever presses.
 * 
 * @section files Key Files
 * - **operant_PR.ino**: Main sketch with progressive ratio logic.
 * - **Cue.h/.cpp**: Manages the cue tone with frequency and duration.
 * - **Laser.h/.cpp**: Controls periodic laser stimulation.
 * - **Lever.h/.cpp**: Tracks lever presses with debouncing and press type.
 * - **LickCircuit.h/.cpp**: Monitors licking behavior.
 * - **Pump.h/.cpp**: Delivers rewards with adjustable infusion settings.
 * 
 * @section usage Usage
 * Configure the active lever (e.g., `ACTIVE_LEVER_RH`), arm devices, and start with `START-PROGRAM`. Adjust ratios via `SET_RATIO:` and `SET_PRATIO:` commands.
 * 
 * @see operant_PR namespace for detailed documentation.
